# K-Means

# Homework #4  
- Download the Mall Customer Segmentation Data from our github repo.
- Use only 3 features (Age, Income and Spending Score) and run k-means algorithm. Determine/choose the optimum "k" value using the elbow method. Show your plot (error vs. k)
- Again with the same 3 features, scatter your data in a 3D plot. Coloring of samples should denote the determined categories (your optimum k). I.e. we should be able to distinguish the samples of k categories.
